If you want to change this as you please then fork the repo and change the words inside the `let hiragana` array.

To get started with this repo you can use this 1 liner:

`git clone https://github.com/Mitchyopp/Kana-learner; cd Kana-learner && cargo run` THIS IS ONLY FOR INSTALL.

or just 

`git clone https://github.com/Mitchyopp/Kana-learner`
